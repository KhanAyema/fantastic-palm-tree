This project aims to predict the survival chances of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. By analyzing passenger data such as age, gender, ticket class, and other relevant features, the model determines the likelihood of survival.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, which contains information about passengers, including:

Passenger ID
